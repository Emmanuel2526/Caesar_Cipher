# Cryptographic_Ciphers
A repository for programme that help in the encryption and decryption of various cryptographic ciphers.

# RSA
The rsa.py file allows for RSA encryption, but has to be
fed the public key. It also allows you to specify encryption
block length, which if not specified it will take the length
of each word in a given string of text as its block length.
